I use Vundle to management my vim plugins. You can refer to this link for more information: [Vundle]( https://github.com/gmarik/vundle )

#Install with:

    git clone https://github.com/andyque/dotvim.git ~/.vim

    cd ~/.vim

    git submodule init --update

    ./install.sh
    
#Install plugins

Open a arbitrary file and run the following ex command of vim:

    :BundleInstall

#Config YouCompleteMe plugin

You can refer to [this link](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) for more information.

#Tips:
    If you want to use the full power of these vim plugins, you should install python,ruby ctags,jsctags.
